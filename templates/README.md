The application provides a dashboard, product category pages, and a confirmation popup after form submissions.

### Project Structure

- `project.py`: Main Flask app with routes handling user interactions, database insertions, and page rendering.
- `db.py`: Database connection module (assumed MySQL).
- `test_project.py`: Unit tests using `pytest` to verify database insertions for sellers, buyers, and bags.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `templates/html/`: HTML template files for all pages.
- `static/uploads/`: Directory where uploaded images are saved.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask app:
   python project.py
4. Open your browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the app.

5. Add a note about your database setup

Since your app depends on MySQL and a `db.py` connection, itâ€™s good to mention this so users know they need to set it up before running.

Example:

```markdown
### Database Setup

- Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
- Create a database (e.g., `bagbazzar`) and run the required SQL scripts to create tables (`sellers`, `buyers`, `bags`).
- Update your `db.py` with your MySQL credentials.
- Sample table creation scripts can be added here or in a separate file.
